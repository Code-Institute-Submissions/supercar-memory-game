Hello and welcome to my 'Readme', the Readme will give you lot's of information about the game that I have constructed.

The game has been constructed for my Code Institute Frontend Development milestone project.

UX.

I built a supercar memory game at first with a choice of 10 cars and 20 windows with a grescale backgroud and gave the game to my friends and family for feedback.

Feedback received was.

A. Not enough cars,
B. Too easy,
C. The greyscale background is not very easy on the eyes,
D. Possibly need '?' rather than 'Click Me' messages,

So the feedback was taken onboard and changes were made.

A. 20 cars now added with 5 spares to change appearance of game in the future,
B. Windows now change colour when clicked upon once from green to yellow to throw concentration,
C. The greyscale background is now green and yellow with '?',


FEATURES.

A. The memory game consists of 40 windows with 20 supercar pair images hidden,
B. The object of the game is to click two windows to try and match a supercar pair,
C. Once a window has been clicked an image appears and waits until a second window is clicked,
D. If the images match they stay open,
E. If the images do not match there is an interval timer of 2 seconds that will return the windows to the '?' mark background,
F. Messages will be displayed once certain actions have been applied,

ie.

Click any window,
Sorry No Match have another go,
Match Found. Your Doing Great click for more supercars,
Congratulations You have won Click begin to start new game,
