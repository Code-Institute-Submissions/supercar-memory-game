Hello and welcome to my 'Readme', the Readme will give you lot's of information about the game that I have constructed.

The website has been constructed for my Code Institute Frontend Development milestone project.

This is my attempt at a small memory game consisting of 12 supercar pairs to try and memorize
and then pick the correct pair.

I have constructed the website using HTML5 ,CSS3 ,Bootstrap 4 and Javascript/JQuery.

The file structure is compiled with one main folder called 'Supercar-Memory-Game' which contains sub folders as listed below.

git html css js and images 

I hope I have covered everything, so please enjoy the game.

Please give feedback on jfsystemsuk@yahoo.co.uk

Regards James (snake coding).
